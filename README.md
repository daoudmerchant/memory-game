# Brief

To create a memory game using entirely functional components. The rules are:

- The user is presented with a selection of pictures and must click one
- On each click, a new set of pictures is displayed
- For each new set of pictures, the user must try to click a new picture

## Thoughts before beginning

I want this one to look good, so I intend on creating a few animations and will make it at least basically responsive. I'm relatively sure that wherever I choose to store the 'score' logic, there'll be a better solution out there (perhaps involving Redux), but I'm pretty sure I can get functionality there.
